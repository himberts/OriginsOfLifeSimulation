# OriginsOfLifeSimulation
Monte Carlo Simulation to investigate the formation of RNA pre-polymers under early earth conditions

This is the source code to the program described in:
Himbert, S., Chapman, M., Deamer, D. W., & Rheinst√§dter, M. C. (2016). Organization of nucleotides in different environments and the formation of pre-polymers. Scientific reports, 6(1), 1-12.

# Installation
The program is written in c++. Compile the source-code with an appropirate compiler (e.g. g++)
